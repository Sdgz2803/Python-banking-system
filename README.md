# Python-banking-system
Hello, I am Samuel Gomez. I created this project with the aim of building my portfolio as a programmer. The code is a basic banking management system in Python that allows users to register, log in, and perform banking operations such as reading account data, depositing, withdrawing money, and deleting accounts. It uses CSV files to store user and account information, and an SQLite database to manage the data in a structured manner. It includes functions to validate inputs, update balances, and delete accounts, as well as an interactive menu for user navigation.
